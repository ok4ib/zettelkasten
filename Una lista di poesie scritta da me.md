## There is a heaven.
```
There is a heaven; believe me, I've seen it.
But your skin is too white to let
Your little hands

Slit your wrists and kill yourself.
```
## Innocence
```
May the truth never get to you.
May the sun never find your skin.

May your eyes never see the guilt.
May the world never find your doll.
```
## I had a dream of an angel.

```Text
My eyes won't mirror him.
When dreams will fall from the sky,
no angel's face will see me.
If I surrender the church,
no angel's face will see me.
No route through self-destruction.
```

## My walls keep me far from you,
```
but you won't see them.
I'm keeping myself from falling back
into the habit of living.
```



## No angel will spare you in the end.
```
With their plastic gloves,
coddling and digging
their way down your chest.
```
